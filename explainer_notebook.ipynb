    "When I started gathering the data, I didn't have a specific goal in mind regarding what I wanted to investigate and present to the reader. Rather, I wanted the ideas to form while I was uncovering the data. To me, that's the beauty of data science - it's and endless journey where each turn you take opens up new ideas for where to go next. So, instead of choosing a particular message to pass on to the reader, I would like to invite them to join me on this journey, and use my data and findings as a parting point to carry out their own study of whichever aspect they find interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the deadline for the project was approaching, it was clear to me that it will not be possible to both clean and process the data, analyze it, write a great story, turn it into a website, and provide technical documentation that would live up to a standard that I would like to keep before May 14<sup>th</sup>. Therefore, I have approached this project as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a general philosophy, I have decided that I would rather do fewer things well than more things sloppily, not least because I find the data very interesting and would like to continue to work with it in the future. Also, as a sole member of my group, I have already shown through assignments 1 and 2 that I can apply the material we have learned in this course, so I see no reason to drag you through a safari of histograms, pairplots, confusion matrices, heatmaps, and linear regression plots just to show you I can create them.<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because I consider good organization of data a foundation for all the other work, I have decided to put great emphasis on, cleaning, processing, and organizing the data, as well as documentation thereof. First when the data was ready and the whole process of its processing documented, I would continue with the rest of the project.<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because I have no prior experience in webpage design, I have decided to design the webpage as a Jupyter Notebook, as learning to create webpages from scratch would, however interesting, simply take too much time from creating their content, which I would rather focus on in this course.<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the webpage, I have decided to start with the analysis of the data describing the number of foreigners in Copenhagen over time, and later relate and compare this to other demographical quantities, such as income, income inequality, average lifespan, number of children, marital status, and so on. However, at May 14 th, I was still working with the immigration data, and decided to stick to this subject alone.<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the data analysis, I have decided to start writing the story for the webpage, let this story inspire the choice of the analysis to perform, and let its results inspire the continuation of the story. Therefore, in the data analysis-section, you will find (almost) solely analysis which is mentioned on the webpage. \n",

Also, the format and the resolution of the data representing the same quantities, such as age and time, was not always consistent.

In fact, now, after more than 20 full working days, I still feels like I'm just getting started.\n",

Henriksen preach about the dangers of foreigners constituting a given percentage of the population in a given area, they tend to present the foreigners as one solid group determined to do you no good, whereas the reality is that the foreign group can consist of hundreds of different nationalities with very little in common. But that being said, there is still so much more to be done, e.g. I haven't even started investigating the relationships between different quantities, which could lead to very interesting insights.\n",

    "As mentioned before, I have chosen not make this project a tour of all the tools and techniques which we have worked with using the semester, as I have already demonstrated my understanding of them in the two assignments over during the semester, and using them for no other reason than to show them to my teachers did not make much sense to me. For that reason, my project is heavily oriented towards data processing, and less towards the analysis. I do, however, intend to pursue the analysis part when this semester ends, and I hope some of you can also find the data I have gathered about Copenhagen for your own research."
